## Copyright and License
It is unlikely there is much copyrightable material in this code as explained in this [blog post by Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/ai-assisted-development-and-open-source-navigating-legal-issues); 
"Because of the highly functional nature of code, source files are already generally a mix of copyrightable and noncopyrightable material, and open source license grants apply only to the parts that are copyright-protected."
